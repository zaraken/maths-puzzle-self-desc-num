Maths Puzzle: The self descriptive number - solutions

I came across a maths puzzle in a youtube video presented by a person named James, who talks about numbers.
It goes like this: "I have a ten digit number. The first digit tells me how many zeros are in the number. The second digit tells me how many ones are in the number. The third digit tells me how many twos are in the number, and so on until the tenth digit which tells me how many nines are in the number. What is my number?"

Here are solutions to the stated problem.

Discussion of the solutions can be found here http://slightlysciency.blogspot.de/2016/01/maths-puzzle-self-descriptive-number.html?view=classic
